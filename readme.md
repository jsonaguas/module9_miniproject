Utilizing Bootstrap elements, I have created a mock task manager website that 
is semi-functional. The landing page will have its marquee element, the carousel 
that will have call-to-action items for users to learn more about the product. 
Clicking on the 'About' link in the nav bar will also arrive at the same destination.

The Task Manager website will require a user account so users will either be directed
to register for an account or sign in. The new user form is in a separate page; it
contains checkpoints of validation for all fields and provides valid or invalid
feedback. The sign-in section also has the same validation for email and password.
Pressing submit as an existing user or register as a new user will direct the user 
to the dashboard of the task manager. 

The dashboard displays current tasks and the ability to add to the list by creating
a new task. Adding a new task employs the modal with a form in its body. I also added
a modal when the user chooses to edit an existing task. Next to each task is a checkbox
where theoretically with more sophisticated functionality, there would be a
subsequent action such as clearing the task or striking out the text perhaps.
